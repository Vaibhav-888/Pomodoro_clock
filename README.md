# Pomodoro Clock

This is a simple Pomodoro clock application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Timer Mechanism**: The application implements the Pomodoro Technique, alternating between work sessions and breaks.
- **Customizable Timers**: The duration of work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks can be customized.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual cues to indicate when it's time to work and when it's time for a break.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset the timer and start a new session.
- **Checkmarks**: Keeps track of completed work sessions with checkmarks displayed on the UI.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `pomodoro.py` file using Python.
4. Click on the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
5. Use the "Reset" button to reset the timer at any time.
6. Enjoy improved productivity and focus with the Pomodoro Technique!
